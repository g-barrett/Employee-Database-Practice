I wanted to get some practice in with MySQL along with queries to the database for functionality of updating databases from client actions on an app.

## Installation
When you clone the code you'll want to run an `npm i` in your terminal. Then, run `mysql -u root -p` and sign in to your MySQL. Source both the schema and seed sql files in that order with command `source db/______`.Once you've done that, exit sql by typing `quit`. The cide should be ready to use.

## Usage
Run `node index.js` in your terminal. After that, you'll be given a list of actions to choose from. Choose whichever you want and provide the information asked for. The database will change based on whatever actions you choose!
